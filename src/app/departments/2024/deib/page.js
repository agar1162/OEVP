                    Created to ensure the Office of the Executive President (OEVP) and its
                    departments have the research to support projects, public statements,
                    and information for the wider campus community. We are tasked with
                    supporting the development of policy briefs and crafting and analyzing
                    surveys and student climate data. This department is the primary bridge
                    between the OEVP and various cultural and identity caucuses across
                    campus. Lastly, this department works closely with the Vice Chancellor
                    for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, to ensure their office is properly
                    serving the student body.
